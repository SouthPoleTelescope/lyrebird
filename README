Environment Variables needed to be set:

export SPT3G_SOFTWARE_PATH=[path to spt3g_software]
export SPT3G_SOFTWARE_BUILD_PATH=[path to where you built spt3g software]


Program dependencies:
-cmake
-g++ or clang++

Library dependencies:

libGL
libGLU
libGLEW
libfftw3
libpthread
libXi 
libXxf86vm
libXrandr
libX11
libXinerama 
libXcursor

I know that's a lot so just type:

sudo apt-get install xorg-dev
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev 
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev

Once you have done that you need to install glfw3 (not earlier versions)
This may or may not live in your favorite package manager.  If it doesn't see: http://www.glfw.org/

Once that is out of the way in the root directory type:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

If you would like to build with a different compiler like clang use:

cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++

Instead of cmake ..
